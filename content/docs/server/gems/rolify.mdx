Rolify is a Ruby on Rails gem that provides a flexible way to handle roles and permissions for users within your application. Essentially, it allows you to assign roles to users and define what actions they can perform. It's especially useful for implementing role-based access control (RBAC), where users with different roles have different levels of access and capabilities.
