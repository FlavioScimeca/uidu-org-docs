Ruby gems are packages of Ruby code that extend the functionality of Ruby applications. They serve various purposes, such as providing libraries for web development, data processing, testing, and more. Gems simplify the process of sharing and reusing code, allowing developers to easily integrate third-party functionality into their projects. By using gems, developers can save time and effort, focusing on building their applications rather than reinventing the wheel.
